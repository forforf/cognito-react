#### Sign Up vs Register
Interchangeable for this app.
The original term was "Sign Up", but this was too close to "Sign In" for me.
Historically I was following the AWS Cognito naming, which uses the term "Sign Up", but I think "register" is a better term and I'm migrating the app toward that term.
There are still many places that use "Sign Up", but those should diminish over time.
